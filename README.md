MOHIDLagragian is a both a library for the [MOHID Water Modelling System](http://www.mohid.com) and a standalone program. The library implements all the necessary tools to generate a comprehensive Lagrangian tracer model, with sources, sinks, particle types and several options for forcing and I/O.

The MOHIDLagrangian program is a specific implementation of the library, designed as a post-processing or online tool, ready to be forced with other models.
