Module to hold and wrap all the tracer respective modules. Defines a pure Lagrangian tracer block. This is intended to serve as the base class for every type of tracer class needed, that should be ~\newline
 built as derived of this class, with the necessary modifiers to model the desired behaviour. Basic tracer data (parameters, variables) are implemented. Tracer methods such as I/O, integration and interpolation routines are implemented.
